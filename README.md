- Multiples of 3 or 5:

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. 
The sum of these multiples is 23.
Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in. 
Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0 (for languages that do have them).
Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.

- Stop gninnipS My sdroW!:

Write a function that takes in a string of one or more words, and returns the same string, 
but with all five or more letter words reversed (Just like the name of this Kata). 
Strings passed in will consist of only letters and spaces. 
Spaces will be included only when more than one word is present.
Examples:
spinWords( "Hey fellow warriors" ) => returns "Hey wollef sroirraw" 
spinWords( "This is a test") => returns "This is a test" 
spinWords( "This is another test" )=> returns "This is rehtona test"

- Find the odd int:

Given an array of integers, find the one that appears an odd number of times.
There will always be only one integer that appears an odd number of times.
Examples
[7] should return 7, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
[0] should return 0, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
[1,1,2] should return 2, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
[0,1,0,1,0] should return 0, because it occurs 3 times (which is odd).
[1,2,2,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,2,2,1] should return 4, because it appears 1 time (which is odd).

- Sum of Digits / Digital Root:

Digital root is the recursive sum of all the digits in a number.
Given n, take the sum of the digits of n. If that value has more than one digit, continue reducing in this way until 
a single-digit number is produced. The input will be a non-negative integer.
Examples
    16  -->  1 + 6 = 7
   942  -->  9 + 4 + 2 = 15  -->  1 + 5 = 6
132189  -->  1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 8 + 9 = 24  -->  2 + 4 = 6
493193  -->  4 + 9 + 3 + 1 + 9 + 3 = 29  -->  2 + 9 = 11  -->  1 + 1 = 2

- Who likes it?:

You probably know the "like" system from Facebook and other pages. People can "like" blog posts, pictures or other items. 
We want to create the text that should be displayed next to such an item.
Implement the function which takes an array containing the names of people that like an item. 
It must return the display text as shown in the examples:
[]                                -->  "no one likes this"
["Peter"]                         -->  "Peter likes this"
["Jacob", "Alex"]                 -->  "Jacob and Alex like this"
["Max", "John", "Mark"]           -->  "Max, John and Mark like this"
["Alex", "Jacob", "Mark", "Max"]  -->  "Alex, Jacob and 2 others like this"

- Array.diff:

Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.
It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b keeping their order.
array_diff([1,2],[1]) == [2]
If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:
array_diff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]

- Create Phone Number:

Write a function that accepts an array of 10 integers (between 0 and 9), 
that returns a string of those numbers in the form of a phone number.
Example
create_phone_number([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]) # => returns "(123) 456-7890"
The returned format must be correct in order to complete this challenge.
Don't forget the space after the closing parentheses!

- Bit Counting:

Write a function that takes an integer as input, and returns the number of bits that are equal to one 
in the binary representation of that number. 
You can guarantee that input is non-negative.
Example: The binary representation of 1234 is 10011010010, so the function should return 5 in this case

- Find The Parity Outlier:

You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. 
The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N. 
Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" N.
Examples
[2, 4, 0, 100, 4, 11, 2602, 36]
Should return: 11 (the only odd number)
[160, 3, 1719, 19, 11, 13, -21]
Should return: 160 (the only even number)

- Counting Duplicates:

Count the number of Duplicates
Write a function that will return the count of distinct case-insensitive alphabetic characters and numeric 
digits that occur more than once in the input string. 
The input string can be assumed to contain only alphabets (both uppercase and lowercase) and numeric digits.
Example
"abcde" -> 0 # no characters repeats more than once
"aabbcde" -> 2 # 'a' and 'b'
"aabBcde" -> 2 # 'a' occurs twice and 'b' twice (`b` and `B`)
"indivisibility" -> 1 # 'i' occurs six times
"Indivisibilities" -> 2 # 'i' occurs seven times and 's' occurs twice
"aA11" -> 2 # 'a' and '1'
"ABBA" -> 2 # 'A' and 'B' each occur twice

- Duplicate Encoder:

The goal of this exercise is to convert a string to a new string where each character in the new string is 
"(" if that character appears only once in the original string, or ")" if that character appears more than once in 
the original string. Ignore capitalization when determining if a character is a duplicate.
Examples
"din"      =>  "((("
"recede"   =>  "()()()"
"Success"  =>  ")())())"
"(( @"     =>  "))((" 
Notes
Assertion messages may be unclear about what they display in some languages. 
If you read "...It Should encode XXX", the "XXX" is the expected result, not the input!
